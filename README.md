FlxTilemap-Demo: The FlxMinimap Editon
======================================

This repository contains a simple, barebones implementation of a minimap for compatible with flixel 2.55. I based the
demo completely on the great [FlxTilemap-Demo](https://github.com/LordTim/FlxTilemap-Demo) project he made (and is in 
use on flixel homepage [here](http://flixel.org/features.html).
